# Data Source
This assignment would use the same data as the assignment 1.
![img](https://www.happierway.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Capture-1.png)

The data source is the same as the data in the first assignment.

```{r getData}
link = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tianyl27/543_coursework_2/main/WHR2021.csv'

# getting the data TABLE from the file:
WHRData2021 <- read.csv(file=url(link))
```

#### 1. [Practice] Picture of 2020 Covid Death per 1000000 population

#### 1.1 get the data
```{r}
# get COVID death data
CovidDeath = cbind(WHRData2021[,1:3],WHRData2021[,23])
colnames(CovidDeath) = c('Country', 'Region','Continent', 'DeathRate')

# delete rows with na values: None
CovidDeath = CovidDeath[complete.cases(CovidDeath),]

# order by death rate in 2020 and show the first 20 countries
CovidDeath=CovidDeath[order(-CovidDeath$DeathRate),]
head(CovidDeath,20)
```
#### 1.2 prepare the title and caption text for the picture
```{r}
# title and caption text
TitleText = "Covid Death Rate in 2020 by Region"
CaptionText = "Source: https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/"
```

#### 1.3 plot the picture
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# order by the mean death rate of each region
# set the range of y axis
baseMEANs = ggplot(CovidDeath, aes(x=reorder(Region,DeathRate, mean),
                             y=DeathRate), ylim=c(0,80)) + theme_classic() + xlab("Region") + ylab("Covid Death per 100000 population")

# add error bar
point=baseMEANs + geom_point(stat="summary") + geom_errorbar(stat="summary") + coord_flip()

# show the graph
point
```
```{r}
# add the pre-aggregated data in the graph, using dots
jitterMEANs= baseMEANs + geom_jitter(colour="blue",
                             alpha=0.2 #transparency
                             )
jitterMEANs=jitterMEANs + geom_point(stat="summary") +
             geom_errorbar(stat="summary") + coord_flip()
# scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 10, 25, 50, 75))
jitterMEANs=jitterMEANs + labs(title=TitleText, caption=CaptionText) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0), plot.caption = element_text(hjust = -1))
jitterMEANs
```
Several Findings:
1) Europe was the most affected areas by the COVID epidemic in terms of death rate in 2020 while Asia was the least affected areas.
2) North America and ANZ has the largest in-group variance, partly due to the small size of countries.
Although Europe was hit by the epidemic badly, countries in Europe still ranked high in the happiness ranking.  



#### 2. [Practice] Picture of Gini coefficient and median age  

The Gini coefficient measures the inequality among values of a frequency distribution (for example, levels of income). A Gini coefficient of zero expresses perfect equality, where all values are the same (e.g. where everyone has the same income). A Gini coefficient of one (or 100%) expresses maximal inequality among values  

#### 2.1 data
The two variables are available in the original csv file. The Gini coefficient is coded as "Gini.coefficient.of.income" and the median age is coded as "Median.age".  

Get to know the distribution of Gini coefficient:
```{r}
summary(WHRData2021$Gini.coefficient.of.income)
```
For OECD countries, in the late 20th century, considering the effect of taxes and transfer payments, the income Gini coefficient ranged between 0.24 and 0.49.  

#### 2.2 plot the two variables
```{r}
base = ggplot(WHRData2021, aes(x=Median.age,y=Gini.coefficient.of.income)) + theme_classic() + xlab("Median age") + ylab("Gini coefficient")

# set the range of both x and y axis
plot1= base +  geom_point(aes(colour=factor(Continent))) + xlim(c(10,50))+ ylim(c(20,70))
plot1

# add the fitted line
plot2 = plot1 + stat_smooth(method='lm') + theme(legend.title=element_blank())
# plot2 = plot1 + stat_smooth(method='lm', se=F) + theme(legend.title=element_blank())
plot2

# non-linear
plot3 = plot1 + geom_smooth() + theme(legend.title=element_blank())
# plot3


```


```{r}
densePlot1 = plot2 + facet_wrap(~Continent,ncol = 1, strip.position = 'top') + theme(legend.position="none") 

densePlot1 = densePlot1 + theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(0.1, "lines"),
                              axis.title.y = element_blank(),
                              axis.text.y = element_blank(),
                              axis.line.y = element_blank(),
                              axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
                              strip.background = element_rect(colour="white"),
                              strip.text.y = element_text(size=10,
                                    color="black",
                                    angle = 0))
densePlot1

# try col = 4
densePlot2 = plot2 + facet_wrap(~Continent,ncol = 4, strip.position = 'top') + theme(legend.position="none") 
densePlot2 = densePlot2 + theme(panel.spacing.y = unit(0.1, "lines"),
                              #axis.title.y = element_blank(),
                              #axis.text.y = element_blank(),
                              #axis.line.y = element_blank(),
                              #axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
                              strip.background = element_rect(colour="white"),
                              strip.text.y = element_text(size=10,
                                    color="black",
                                    angle = 0))
densePlot2

```
Several findings:
1) The inverse relationship between Median age and Gini Coefficient holds true in most cases.
2) Europe has the highest median age, thus the smallest Gini coefficient among the four major groups.
3) Asia has the largest in-group variance in Median age.  



#### 3. [Practice] Picture of GDP per capital and Life Expectancy
A great deal of research has been performed on whether wealth can, in fact, increase happiness. Among the many papers, projects, surveys, and proposals are hypotheses showing varying levels of correlation between per capita GDP and quality of life. These also include several works by recent Nobel laureate, Sir Angus Deaton, a professor Princeton University. 

#### 3.1 data
The plot will use the two related variables from the data source.  

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

```



#### 3.2 plot the two variables

```{r}
base3 = ggplot(WHRData2021, aes(x=Logged.GDP.per.capita, y=Healthy.life.expectancy, size=Population.2020, color=Regional.indicator)) + geom_point(alpha=0.5)
base3 + scale_size(range=c(.1,24), name="Population in 2020") + geom_text_repel(label=WHRData2021$Country.name, size=2)

```
